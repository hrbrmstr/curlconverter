Description: Deciphering web/'REST' 'API' and 'XHR' calls can be tricky, which is one reason
    why internet browsers provide "Copy as 'cURL'" functionality within their "Developer Tools"
    pane(s). These 'cURL' command-lines can be difficult to wrangle into an 'httr' 'GET' or
    'POST' request, but you can now "straighten" these 'cURLs' either from data copied to the
    system clipboard or by passing in a vector of 'cURL' command-lines and getting back a
    list of parameter elements which can be used to form 'httr' requests. You can also make a
    complete/working/callable 'httr::VERB' function right from the tools provided.
SystemRequirements: xclip <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/> or xsel
  <http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/> for accessing the X11
